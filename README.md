## ## sp.constitution

### 📜 Step 1 — The Constitution defines universal project rules

The Constitution is your master rulebook.  
It sets the permanent standards that never change, across the whole project.  
These rules apply to everything you write — today, next week, next year.  
These rules are constant — they do not change from document to document.

**Key points for Constitution:**
- ✔ The global writing standards  
- ✔ The citation and sourcing rules  
- ✔ The required clarity and tone expectations  
- ✔ The quality and integrity principles  
- ✔ The formatting requirements  
- ✔ The review and verification standards  
- ✔ The ethical and academic boundaries  
- ✔ The universal “must always follow” rules  
- ✔ The foundations of professional consistency

## ## sp.specify

### 🧠 Step 2 — You define everything in /sp.specify

Specify is the requirements contract between you and the LLM.  
The Specification only applies to one task at a time — one specific paper.

**In the specification you define:**
- ✔ What you want to build  
- ✔ The goals  
- ✔ The constraints  
- ✔ The success criteria  
- ✔ The boundaries  
- ✔ The audience  
- ✔ What NOT to include

## ## sp.plan

### 🏗️ Step 3 — /sp.plan turns the spec into an execution plan

Once the specification is done, /sp.plan uses it to produce:

- ✔ The architecture of the work  
- ✔ The implementation phases  
- ✔ The order of work  
- ✔ The dependencies  
- ✔ The research strategy  
- ✔ The writing approach  
- ✔ The validation steps  
- ✔ The final polishing steps  

Once your specification clearly defines what you’re building, the Plan Phase decides how you will build it.

## ## sp.tasks

### 🛠️ Step 4 — /sp.tasks Tasks Phase — Breaking Work into Atomic Units

- ✔ A clear specification (intent, success criteria, scope)  
- ✔ A detailed implementation plan (phases, timeline, research strategy)  
- ✔ Documented architecture decisions (format, citation style, source strategy)  

**How a Task Is:**
- **Time:** 15–30 minutes  
- **Focus:** One clear goal  
- **Output:** Produces something you can check (file, section, validated result)  
- **Dependencies:** Either independent or clearly depends on other tasks  

---

## ## sp.implement

### 🏃  Step 5 -/ sp.Implementation Implementation Phase — Doing the Work

**Goal:** Execute tasks with AI, following your specification.

 ✔ You decide direction, AI executes tasks.  
 ✔ Every output is checked against your spec.  
 ✔ Implementation = doing tasks.md to meet success criteria, not ad-hoc work.

## 🔹 Short metaphor

- **The Constitution** = overall classroom rules  
- **The Specification** = instructions for one specific homework assignment, blueprint of the destination  
- **The Plan** = the step-by-step route to get there  
- **The Task** = Break work into tiny, verifiable steps with checkpoints to stay in control and catch problems early.  
- **Implementation** = Actually doing the homework together with AI, checking it meets the rules

-Spec-Kit Plus ensures structured, high-quality work by combining clear rules, precise specifications, and step-by-step plans.  
-Breaking work into tasks and executing with AI keeps you in control and guarantees measurable success.
